# Hybrid System of State-Space Model and Transformer for Time-series Forecasting
==============================

Time series forecasting is an important research topic in machine learning due to its prevalence in social and scientific applications. Multi-model forecasting paradigm, including model hybridization and model combination, is shown to be more effective than single-model forecasting in the M4 competition. In this study, we hybridize exponential smoothing with transformer architecture to capture both levels and seasonal patterns while exploiting the complex non-linear trend in time series data. We show that our model can capture complex trends and seasonal patterns with moderately improvement in comparison to the state-of-the-arts result from the M4 competition.

## Usage
To test the optimal model, change to main.py directory and run the following command: 

```console
cd "./hybcast"
python src/main.py --dataset "Yearly" --gpu_id 0 --use_cpu 0
```
Use `--help` to get the description of each argument:

```console
python src/main.py --help
```

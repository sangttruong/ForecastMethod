The examined data sets were GBP/USD and EUR/USD. Hyperparameters both ARIMA and NNM were optimized using exhaustive search inspired by the Box-Jenkins methodology. The result shows that the most significant determinant of a Forex rate data point is its previous lag. This paper gives an insight into Forex market and provides a simple forecasting strategy for Forex investors in the era of globalization.

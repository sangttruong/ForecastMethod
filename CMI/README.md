# Cummins projects

This repository hold all of my work when I'm an Co-Op at Cummins Inc. (August 2019 to January 2020). Some notable projects are: 
* Establishing several time-series models to forecast multi-dependent time-series.
* Evaluating performance of some global business units
* Automating data processing for period-end report.
